<font face="times new roman"> By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–
    Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.

    As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and
    to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India after the partition in August 1947,
    personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died a year after Pakistan's creation and was
    buried at Mazar-e-Quaid. He is revered in Pakistan as the Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation") and Quaid-e-Azam
    ("Great Leader"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.
